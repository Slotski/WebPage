                    <h2>Exclusion of liability - Disclaimer:</h2>
                    <h3>Liability for content</h3>
                    <p>All content on our website has been created with the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge. However, we cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness, and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 (1) TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this.</p>
                
                    <p>However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time at which we become aware of a specific infringement. If we become aware of the above-mentioned infringements, we will remove this content immediately.</p>
                
                    <h3>Limitation of liability for external links</h3>
                    <p>Our website contains links to external third-party websites. We have no influence on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. We, therefore, cannot assume any liability for the accuracy of the content of “external links”. The respective providers or operators (authors) of the pages are responsible for the content of the external links.</p>
                
                    <p>The external links were checked for possible legal violations at the time the link was created and were free of illegal content at the time the link was created. A constant check of the content of external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a legal violation. In the case of direct or indirect links to third-party websites that are outside our area of responsibility, liability would only exist if we became aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the event of illegal content.</p>
                
                    <p>This disclaimer of liability also applies to links and references from questioners, blog entries, and guests of the discussion forum within the “name of your domain” website. The service provider of the page to which reference is made is solely liable for illegal, incorrect, or incomplete content and, in particular, for damage resulting from the use or non-use of such information, not the person who merely refers to the respective publication via links.</p>
                
                    <p>If we become aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove the external links.</p>
